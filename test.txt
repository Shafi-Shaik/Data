Database Table, Column Testing
Let us look into various checks for database and column testing.

Whether the mapping of the database fields and columns in the backend is compatible with those mappings in the front-end?
Validation of the length and naming convention of the database fields and columns as specified by the requirements.
Validation of the presence of any unused/unmapped database tables/columns.
Validation of the compatibility of the
datatype
field lengths
of the back-end database columns with that of those present at the front-end of the application.

Whether the database fields allow the user to provide desired user inputs as required by the business requirement specification documents.
